To run this code, you'll need Python and the Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with Python in most cases. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Check if Tkinter is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python -m tkinter
If a small window pops up, then Tkinter is installed. If not, you can install it using the package manager for your Python installation (such as pip or conda).

Create a new file (e.g., currency_converter.py) and copy the code provided into the file.

And Run the code.
